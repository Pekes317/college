  <div id="text"><p>Why is learning so important to successful transformation  and what does “Transformation through Learning” mean? Further, how does an  organization or an individual successfully create transformation? The one-page  briefs we call “Tips for Successful Transformation” will explore these issues  and others related to successfully transforming. Frequently, we will add a new  installment that will further explain our approaches to helping both  individuals and organizations transform. We hope you will find these short  articles to be both informative and insightful and will revisit us at  AlexisGill.com for new installments of “Tips for Successful  Transformation.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  First, let’s define transformation by exploring the  difference between “Change” and “Transformation.” We get older. Getting older  is a change, not a transformation. Some people evolve and become more complex,  wiser and braver in their thinking. Evolving to a higher cognitive level of  thinking is an example of transformation.    Does your organization need to transform? What about YOU personally?<br />
  <br />
  Companies buy and sell different parts, fire and hire, ebb  and flow - that is change. At Heritage web solutions we consider ourselves the  change specialists because we understand change and how it affects companies  and individuals. When a company evolves into a whole new organization with new  rules of operations and new ways of working to meet a challenge such as a  weaker economy, then we can say there has been a transformation. In our minds,  transformation should and usually is “for the better”. It is a way of being that  is more complex, more mature and more likely successful given new situations  and changing times. Transformation, we believe, is the best means to deal with  rapid and increasing change. Transformation is created and supported by  learning processes either individual, or organizational. This is why we have  chosen the theme “transformation through learning” to clarify our work. </p>
<p>We believe transformation is a core process for the success  of any organization trying to survive and thrive in the new century. Without  individuals in that organization who are equipped to focus on making deep and  profound personal changes in who they are and how they think and work,  organizations will not be able to adapt to continuous change in the  marketplace. Therefore, organizational transformation, essential in the new  marketplace, is not possible without personal transformation. This presents  organizations with tremendous challenges and uncertain futures unless they can  find new and effective ways to support personal growth and transformation in a  broad segment of their staff. Our work is all about helping organization create  the conditions and experiences needed for personal transformation and hence  organizational transformation. </p>
